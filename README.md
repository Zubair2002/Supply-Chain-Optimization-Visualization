# Supply-Chain-Optimization-Visualization
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain operations by aligning product supply capacities with international demand while minimizing total operational costs. Using linear programming (PuLP), the model determines optimal product allocations across countries, balancing shipping costs and unmet demand penalties.
