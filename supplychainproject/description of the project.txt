Project: Supply Chain Demand Fulfillment & Cost Optimization

Objective: Optimize supply chain operations by aligning product supply with international demand while minimizing total costs.

Approach: Applied Linear Programming (LP) to allocate shipments of multiple products across countries.

Optimization Focus:

Minimized shipping costs

Minimized penalty costs from unmet demand

Key Outputs Generated:

Allocation matrix (product-to-country shipment plan)

Supply utilization summary (capacity used vs. remaining)

Demand fulfillment report (shipped vs. unmet demand, fulfillment % per country)

Optimization cost breakdown (shipped cost, penalty cost, total cost)

KPIs Tracked:

Fulfillment percentage by country

Supply utilization rates by product

Cost composition (shipped vs. penalty costs)

Visualizations Created:

Demand vs. fulfillment (per country, top 10 for clarity)

Supply capacity vs. shipped quantity (per product, top 10 for clarity)

Cost distribution breakdown

Ranked plots for high-demand countries & heavily utilized products

Automation: All reports exported as CSV files and presentation-ready plots for decision support.

Operations Management Principles Applied:

Resource allocation

Cost optimization

Capacity planning

Performance monitoring
